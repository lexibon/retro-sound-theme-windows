This is a custom Windows sound theme made on BeepBox. When saving the file, save it where it's easier to find!
-------------------------------------------------------------

How to use:

go to Settings -> Sound -> More Sound Settings.

Once it pops up, select the "sounds" tab.

To replace the sounds, click on a sound in the box, select "browse", and find the sound in the "Retro" folder.

The window automatically provides sounds from that folder after that, so to replace the next sounds, you can use the drop-down list.

Be sure to click "apply" every now and then.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy your sound theme!
